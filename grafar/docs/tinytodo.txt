todo:

* [x] Upfalg in table 
* [x] Virtual multiplication
* [x] refresh on export 
* [x] and export only 
* [x] Cascade upflags to children
* [x] eliminate db.known // use needsreplan or smth
* [x] check if re-export needed + 1%
  * [x] grafar.frame with unique id
  * [ ] not current, but for last export
* [ ] test
* [ ] test with real graphs
* [ ] maybe some better external resourse linking (outside the updater)
* [ ] monitor excess time in grafar.update


Generic
* [x] Smooth time
  * [ ] Smooth discrete time: hard / soft limiter or threaded tick w/skipping
* [ ] animation boilerplate
* [ ] culling


Parsing
* [ ] Looped graphs (in graphdata)
* [ ] Merging implicits
* [ ] Border / full
* [ ] reimplement parser as parser only


Implicit computation
* [x] Short-circuit empty implicit areas
* [ ] exploit time-coherence
  * [ ] reuse probe / previous result -- makes super-newton


Data piping
* [ ] remove dataInterface
* [ ] bind export onupdate DB
* [ ] share buffers with computation
  * [ ] offset & itemsize in exports
